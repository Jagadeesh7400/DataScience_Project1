# Sample vs Population Statistical Comparison Dashboard

This project involves creating an interactive Excel-based statistical dashboard to analyze and compare **sample data** with **population data**. The goal is to explore key metrics like central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (range, standard deviation) and provide meaningful insights using visually appealing charts and graphs.

---

## Key Features

1. **Central Tendency Analysis:**
   - Includes **mean**, **median**, and **mode** for both sample and population data.
   - Visual comparison through bar graphs and pie charts.

2. **Dispersion Analysis:**
   - Highlights key measures like **range** and **standard deviation**.
   - Displays distribution trends in sample vs population through comparative charts.

3. **Diverse Data Insights:**
   - Detailed study of critical variables like `CFC-I`, `CFC-F`, and `CFC-Total scale`.
   - Highlights diversity and representativeness of the sample data.

4. **Visual Representation:**
   - Interactive visuals such as **line charts**, **pie charts**, and **bar graphs**.
   - Clear and concise display of statistical measures.

5. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Observations on sample representativeness and diversity of the population data.
   - Facilitates decision-making based on statistical comparison.

6. **Real-Time Analysis:**
   - Updates dynamically with changes in the underlying dataset.

## Conclusion from the Analysis

Based on the population data and the comparison with `YourSample` data:
- **Diversity:** The population exhibits a wide range of characteristics across various metrics.
- **Representativeness:** The sample data approximates the population mean but captures a narrower range, potentially missing extreme values.
- **Variation:** Lower standard deviation in the sample suggests less variability compared to the population.

This project provided a new and challenging opportunity for analysis, offering valuable insights into population diversity and sample representativeness.
