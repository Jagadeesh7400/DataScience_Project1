## Overview

This project implements an **Excel-based statistical dashboard** designed to perform a thorough analysis of **sample data** versus **population data**. By comparing key statistical metrics such as **central tendency** (mean, median, mode) and **dispersion** (range, standard deviation), users can gain insights into data diversity and sample representativeness. 

The dashboard employs dynamic visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to simplify the interpretation of statistical measures and enable quick decision-making.

## Key Features

### **1. Central Tendency Analysis:**
- **Mean, Median, Mode:** Compare central values between sample and population data.
- **Visual Comparison:** Bar charts and pie charts to highlight central measures.

### **2. Dispersion Analysis:**
- **Range and Standard Deviation:** Evaluate the variability of data in both sample and population.
- **Interactive Histograms:** Visualize the spread of data to identify trends and outliers.

### **3. Interactive Dashboard:**
- **Dynamic Slicers and Filters:** Easily select specific time periods or variables to focus on.
- **Real-Time Updates:** As filters change, the dashboard updates instantly with the relevant data.

### **4. Data Representation:**
- Charts, graphs, and tables to represent statistical findings.
- Customizable to meet specific analysis needs.

</p>
- **Central Tendency:** A side-by-side bar graph compares the mean, median, and mode of sample data versus population data.
- **Dispersion Analysis:** Displays a histogram for both sample and population, showing the range and standard deviation.
- **Color Coding:** Different colors help distinguish between sample and population datasets for clarity.

## Key Insights

- **Population Diversity:** The population exhibits a broad range of characteristics, captured across multiple metrics (e.g., `CFC-I`, `CFC-F`, `CFC-Total scale`).
- **Sample Data Representativeness:** While the sample data reflects the population mean, it narrows the data range, missing out on some extreme values.
- **Sample Variability:** The sample’s lower standard deviation suggests less variability, indicating that it might not fully represent the population's diverse characteristics.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download and Open the Excel File:**  
   Download the provided Excel file and open it in **Microsoft Excel** (2016 or later).

2. **Interact with the Dashboard:**
   - Use **slicers** to filter the data by specific variables, such as time periods or categories (e.g., `CFC-I`, `CFC-F`).
   - As you interact with the slicers, all charts and tables will update dynamically to reflect the filtered data.

3. **Customize the Data:**
   - To modify the analysis, add or update datasets in the Excel file. 
   - The dashboard is designed to automatically adapt to new data, allowing for flexible analysis.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the value of statistical analysis for comparing sample and population data:
- **Insights on Data Diversity:** The population dataset offers rich diversity, which is partially captured by the sample.
- **Representativeness Challenges:** The sample data does not fully represent the population due to a narrower range of values.
- **Statistical Value:** This dashboard helps stakeholders make informed decisions based on a clear visual comparison of statistical measures.
